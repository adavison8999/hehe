As you pull into the driveway, you can sense that something is wrong.... It may be the fact that Daddy Pav's Car is in the garage, or maybe the fact that Whitey is nowhere to be seen...Weird

I could try to look for Whitey in the backyard or I could sneak inside to see why Pav is still over.

What should I do?
1. Find the chicken.
2. Tip toe inside.
